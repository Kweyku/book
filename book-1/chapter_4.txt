Chapter 4

After a short time, Tom grows increasingly suspicious of his wife’s relationship with Gatsby. 
At a luncheon at the Buchanans’ house, Gatsby stares at Daisy with such undisguised passion that 
Tom realizes Gatsby is in love with her. Though Tom is himself involved in an extramarital affair, 
he is deeply outraged by the thought that his wife could be unfaithful to him. He forces the group 
to drive into New York City, where he confronts Gatsby in a suite at the Plaza Hotel. Tom asserts 
that he and Daisy have a history that Gatsby could never understand, and he announces to his wife 
that Gatsby is a criminal—his fortune comes from bootlegging alcohol and other illegal activities. 
Daisy realizes that her allegiance is to Tom, 
and Tom contemptuously sends her back to East Egg with Gatsby, attempting to prove that Gatsby 
cannot hurt him.
