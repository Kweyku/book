Chapter 5

When Nick, Jordan, and Tom drive through the valley of ashes, however, they discover 
that Gatsby’s car has struck and killed Myrtle, Tom’s lover. They rush back to Long Island, 
where Nick learns from Gatsby that Daisy was driving the car when it struck Myrtle, but that 
Gatsby intends to take the blame. The next day, Tom tells Myrtle’s husband, George, that Gatsby 
was the driver of the car. George, who has leapt to the conclusion that the driver of the car that 
killed Myrtle must have been her lover, finds Gatsby in the pool at his mansion and shoots him dead. 
He then fatally shoots himself.
