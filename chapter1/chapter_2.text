Chapter 2

Nick is unlike the other inhabitants of West Egg—he was educated at Yale and has social connections in East Egg,
a fashionable area of Long Island home to the established upper class. Nick drives out to East Egg one evening 
for dinner with his cousin, Daisy Buchanan, and her husband, Tom, an erstwhile classmate of Nick’s at Yale.
Daisy and Tom introduce Nick to Jordan Baker, a beautiful, cynical young woman with whom Nick begins a 
romantic relationship. Nick also learns a bit about Daisy and Tom’s marriage: Jordan tells him that Tom has a 
lover, Myrtle Wilson, who lives in the valley of ashes, a gray industrial dumping ground between West Egg and 
New York City. Not long after this revelation, Nick travels to New York City with Tom and Myrtle. At a vulgar, 
gaudy party in the apartment that Tom keeps for the affair, Myrtle begins to taunt Tom about Daisy, and Tom responds by 
breaking her nose.
